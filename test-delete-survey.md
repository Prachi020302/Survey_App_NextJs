# Survey Delete Functionality Test

## Implementation Summary

I've successfully implemented the survey delete functionality in your application. Here's what was added:

### 1. Backend API Endpoint
- **File**: `/src/app/api/surveys/[id]/route.ts`
- **Added**: DELETE endpoint that calls the existing `deleteSurveyService`
- **Functionality**: Handles survey deletion with proper error handling

### 2. Redux Integration
- **File**: `/src/app/redux/slices/surveySlice.ts`
- **Added**: 
  - `deleteSurvey` async thunk for making the DELETE API call
  - Proper reducer cases for handling pending, fulfilled, and rejected states
  - Toast notifications for success/error feedback

### 3. UI Component Update
- **File**: `/src/components/molecules/Surveys/SurveyCard.tsx`
- **Added**:
  - `handleDeleteSurvey` function with confirmation dialog
  - Permission check - only ADMIN users can see and use the delete button
  - Proper integration with Redux state management
  - Automatic survey list refresh after successful deletion

## How to Test

1. **Login as an Admin user**
2. **Navigate to the surveys page**
3. **Click the delete button** on any survey card
4. **Confirm deletion** in the dialog
5. **Verify** the survey is removed from the list and success message is shown

## Key Features

- ✅ **Permission-based**: Only admins can delete surveys
- ✅ **Confirmation dialog**: Prevents accidental deletions
- ✅ **Optimistic updates**: UI refreshes automatically after deletion
- ✅ **Error handling**: Proper error messages and rollback on failure
- ✅ **Toast notifications**: User feedback for success/error states
- ✅ **Type safety**: All TypeScript types properly defined

## Files Modified

1. `/src/app/api/surveys/[id]/route.ts` - Added DELETE endpoint
2. `/src/app/redux/slices/surveySlice.ts` - Added Redux delete functionality
3. `/src/components/molecules/Surveys/SurveyCard.tsx` - Updated UI with delete functionality

The implementation follows the existing patterns in your codebase and maintains consistency with other CRUD operations.
